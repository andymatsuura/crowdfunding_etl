Crowdfunding ETL Project by A.Matsuura and H. Miesbauer
The team built an ETL pipeline using Python and PostgreSQL to build Pandas dataframes in order to examine crowdfunding relationship with the dataset.

Extract-Transform-Load is a key still for a data professional. Often, data comes in different, messy forms and making sense of it can help us to draw meaningful conclusions from a dataset. 

Description
Using Python the team imported csv data, constructed Panda Dataframes, and cleaned the data. The resulting file outputs were used to create the Crowdfunding ETL pipeline.
